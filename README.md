## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### Continued development

I'm creating a project from scratch called "timeline", and I need to migrate the html and css structure to something more responsive, like tailwind. This project helped me to train

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://www.example.com) - Tailwind documentation was the most important resource during the project
